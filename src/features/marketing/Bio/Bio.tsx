        <p><strong>Iâ€™m a { myAge } year-old software engineer, and I've been building for the web for *checks notes* ~{ Math.round(webDays / myAgeInDays * 100) }% of my life.</strong> I picked up PHP in 2007, and built too many sites in the bad old days before HTML5 and CSS3 had broad browser support. I've been on the responsive & mobile-first bandwagon since <a href='https://ethanmarcotte.com/' target='_new'>Ethan Marcotte</a> wrote about it in my favorite weblog, <a href='https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/' target='_new'>A List Apart</a>, in 2010. I rejoiced when my agency finally dropped support for IE 6 & 7. I spent a short time learning MVC with Ruby on Rails, before returning to a post-jQuery <del>Java</del><ins>Type</ins>Script landscape, and quickly found myself at home in a sea of React components.</p>
        <p>I have been building with React for the past { reactYears } years, on top of frameworks like Meteor, Vulcan, Gatsby, and Next.js. I've built static sites and full-stack progressive web apps, and experiences that blur the lines between the two (like this one!)</p>
        <p>After VS Code, my next go-to tool is Figma. A love of good design has always been a core motivation (I was going to be an architect, more on that in a bit) and I design accessible user interfaces as well as build them. I've also been known to do brand & print work for select clients.</p>
        <p>There's nothing quite as rewarding as building a better means for other people to accomplish their goals. Design and engineering are two inseparable sides of the same problem-solving coin, and I can't get enough of all of it.</p>
